# Configuration

The purpose of this repo is to house the code to be used to screen Jr. Dev Ops Engineers.

## Summary

This is just some awesome website that will rival that of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Microsoft combined. We just have to get the configuration off the ground first. Take a look at source and the issue tracker and let me know how you come up with a solution for this.

### What are we looking for?

There are no tricks here, we are looking to see how you think. You are free to use any tool to get to the desired outcome for the test.

The more you put in the more serious contender we believe you to be.
